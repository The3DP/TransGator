# TransGator
TransGator is a simple code translator, always at the ready.
# Notes:
This HTML demo uses simple pattern replacements and only supports a few language pairs. 
Real code translation requires advanced parsing and AI. 
You can extend it with more patterns or connect it to a backend/code translation API for better results.
I may perform the API action in the near-future.
